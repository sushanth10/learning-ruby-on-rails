- Database migration
    You create a database migration first and then you push the database migration to the database.
    Routes are created by rails scaffold when it is generated.
    Also, scaffold makes a bunch of different pages and partial view.
    Migrations are created in db/migrate folder

- Schema is the finished product that is pushed into the Database.
- To push the migration into the database, do `rails db:migrate` which creates a schema.rb file in the config/db directory.

* Scaffolds.scss is a stylesheet file which overwrites the bootstrap css so you can delete it.

- resources:friends in the config/routes.rb automates the CRUD operations in the application. Handles all CRUD operations as a resource.

- To check the routes for the webpages, check `rails routes` which lists all the routes to the webpages.

- Use the prefix_verb+'_path' to while defining the link. The controller#action is used in routes.rb file directly. 

- Friend index (app/views/friends/index.html) is the friend display page.
